If they gave you a grade on your SQL exam, it might be worth listing it along with what the max is.

I'd also cite those facts in my cover letter along with a statement like 
"I bring the same drive that I had to pass an exam that normally requires 2 years of experience to the table."

Last but not least, I'd start answering questions on forums. 
A LOT of questions. Just make sure that you're right. 
There's nothing like a newbie being able to say 
"I have my own copy of the Developer's Edition and have done a lot of work on the forums to try to get the experience you want. 
Here are some links to my work on the forums."

You should also start looking techniques up. These are things that aren't in any of the certification books. 
Learn what a Tally Table is and how it can be used to replace loops. 
Be an absolute expert at being able to generate a million rows of random but constrained test data 
and then test against it to show that you know joins and performance methods. 
Write a backup routine using only T-SQL. 
Write some code that uses DMVs to find what's currently running 
and what the top x worst queries are including the execution plans. 
Learn how to do "catch all" queries. 
Have an impeccable formatting style with good comments in all your code. 
Write some code that uses your mathematical talents. 
Learn CROSS TABs and Pivots. 
Learn how to import data using BCP/BULK insert. 
Learn how to push code to all databases. Etc, etc. 
Make all of that available online on a forum like this one. 
Maybe even start writing some articles (again, do some research... if you publish something wrong, it'll be there forever).

You're actually not fighting anything that a new graduate in any field doesn't have to fight. 
Graduating really only qualifies you to really start learning. 
It sounds like you have the drive... give it a shot.
